The graph clearly shows us how the stock price of Amazon has had an exponential growth
starting more or less from 2009 (giving a monstrous gap to Apple and Microsoft).
In addition we can also note the even more frightening growth during the Covid period.
Apple and Microsoft, on the other hand, are much further away than Amazon but very close
to each other. However it can be seen that Microsoft's stock price is now higher than Apple's.
